# lj_archive
simple r code to: 
 1) read in contents from downloaded archive livejournal posts in csv form 
 2) concatenate rows from each csv into one big combined dataframe
 3) choose columns/vars to keep
 4) convert date/time char data to date/time format
 5) re-order columns
 6) kick the entire thing to a text file

One o'these days I'll mess around more with formatting the text within R before kicking to text file, and maybe doing some sentiment analysis for fun
