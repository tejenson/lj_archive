# lj_archive
A very simple and klunky as all hell steps + code to: 
 1) manually download csv files of all LJ posts
 2) read in contents from downloaded archive livejournal posts in csv form 
 3) concatenate rows from each csv into one big combined dataframe
 4) choose columns/vars to keep
 5) convert date/time char data to date/time format
 6) re-order columns
 7) kick the entire thing to a text file
